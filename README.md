# Notebook App
## Note taking, list making, prroductivity app

This app is inspired by apps like Evernote that allow the user to make notes and collect those notes into notebooks.

The kinds of notes I'm looking to build into this app are:

Notes: Quick/Sticky notes, Journal entries,
Lists: Shopping, Chores/Errands, Goals, Recipies
